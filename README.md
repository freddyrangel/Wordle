# Wordle Clone

Fun little word game where you have to guess the correct word in 6 tries.

You can play the game [here](https://www.freddyrangel.com/wordle/).

## Todos

- Add unit and integration tests (I wanted to avoid using a package manager for now)
- Add a keyboard similar to what NYTimes' Wordle has
- Add animations as user types letters
- Animations for when a word is submitted. Maybe a flipping animation (I went
  down that rabbit hole but the timing is a bit tricky to get right)
- Some kind of notification other than alerts. Maybe a simple modal with `dialog`
- Notification when user types a non-alphabetic word
- A way to keep score would be nice
